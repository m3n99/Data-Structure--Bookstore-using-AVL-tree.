# Data-Structure--Bookstore-using-AVL-tree.

You have to maintain information for a bookstore. Each book should have the following information: book name, author’s name, publishing date, publisher address (i.e., country), and category (fiction or non-fiction). For keeping track of the books that exist at the bookstore, you should implement an efficient system, based on AVL tree data structure, to keep track of the available books with the following operations allows:
. Read the data from a text file (books.txt).
. Create an AVL tree to store the book information (use book’s name as key).
. Insert a new book to the library.
. Search for a book using book’s name or author’s name.
. Update/Delete a specific book (search using the book’s name).
. List books by category in lexicographic order of their names.
. Print the height of the tree.
. Save the data to a file.
The data can be stored in the file as follows:
